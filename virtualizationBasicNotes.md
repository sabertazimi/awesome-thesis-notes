## Memory Management

### `MICRO'15` Large Pages and Lightweight Memory Management in Virtualized Environments

#### Shortcomings of Large Pages

- large pages can reduce consolidation in real-world cloud deployments where memory resources are over-committed by precluding opportunities for page sharing
- large pages can also interfere with a hypervisorâ€™s ability to perform lightweight guest memory usage monitoring (its ability to effectively allocate and place data in non-uniform memory access systems)
- large pages can hamper operations like agile VM migration

As a result, virtualization software often break large pages into smaller baseline pages (lost opportunity in terms of reducing address translation overheads)

#### GLUE (Generalized Large-page Utilization Enhancements)

- GLUE augments standard TLBs to store information that identifies these contiguous, aligned, but splintered regions
- GLUE then uses TLB speculation to identify the constituent translations
- Small system physical pages are speculated by interpolating around the information stored about a single speculative large-page translation in the TLB
